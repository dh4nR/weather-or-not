3. The application uses a dark theme for comfortable viewing in any lighting condition.

## Searching for a Location

3. Select a location from the dropdown to view its weather forecast.
4. After search results appear, you'll find another search bar at the top of the results page for easy navigation to other locations.

## Understanding the Weather Forecast

The weather forecast provides a 7-day outlook with detailed information:

1. **Current Location**: At the top of the page, you'll see the name of the location you searched for.

2. **Weather Summary**: A summary card provides an overview of the forecast period and explains how activities are scored.

3. **Activity Summary Chart**: This chart shows how each day scores for different activities (skiing, surfing, outdoor and indoor sightseeing). The higher the rating (more stars), the better the conditions for that activity.

4. **Daily Forecast Cards**: 
   - Each card shows the forecast for a specific day
   - Click/tap on a card to expand it and see more details
   - In collapsed view, you'll see the date, day, temperature, and weather condition
   - In expanded view, you'll see additional details like precipitation, wind speed, and activity scores

## Activity Scores Explained

Activity scores are calculated based on various weather factors and displayed on a 5-star scale:

1. **Skiing Score**: Based on temperature, snowfall, and precipitation. Ideal conditions are cold temperatures with fresh snowfall.

2. **Surfing Score**: Based on wind speed, precipitation, and temperature. Ideal conditions are moderate winds with clear skies.

3. **Outdoor Sightseeing Score**: Based on temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover. Ideal conditions are warm, dry weather with clear skies.

4. **Indoor Sightseeing Score**: Inversely related to outdoor conditions. Rainy, cold days score higher for indoor activities.

The star color provides additional information:
- Red stars: Poor conditions (1-2 stars)
- Yellow stars: Moderate conditions (3 stars)
- Green stars: Excellent conditions (4-5 stars)

Whether or Not automatically saves your five most recent searches:

1. Your searches are stored in your browser's local storage.

4. To clear your search history, click the "Clear History" button in the recent searches section.
